# Titanic Dataset Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring various aspects, creating visualizations, and implementing machine learning models. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including details such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and survival status.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed via the following URL:
[Download Titanic Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)

## Analysis Steps

### Data Exploration and Visualization

1. **Data Exploration**: We start by loading the dataset and inspecting its structure.

2. **Data Visualization**: We create various visualizations to understand the data better, including histograms, box plots, and more.

   - Histograms and Box Plots for features such as 'Age' and 'Fare'.
   - Male & Female Distribution according to age group (Box plot).
   - Age distribution of male and female passengers who survived.

### Feature Engineering

We enhance the dataset by creating new features:

- Extracting titles from passenger names.
- Creating a 'FamilySize' feature by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch'.
- Handling missing data in the 'Age' column.

### Machine Learning

We implement machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival:

- Feature selection: Choosing relevant features for modeling.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Utilizing a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
- Evaluating the model's performance through accuracy, cross-validation, and a classification report.
- Feature importance analysis to understand which factors most affect survival.

## Running the Code

1. Install the required Python libraries if not already installed. You can use `pip` to install the necessary libraries mentioned in the code.

2. Download the Titanic dataset from the provided URL.

3. Run the Python code provided for data analysis and machine learning. Ensure that you specify the correct path to the dataset in the code.

## Advanced Analysis

You can extend this project by implementing more advanced techniques:

- Hyperparameter tuning for the machine learning model.
- Trying different machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or deep learning models.
- Exploring ethical considerations and biases in the data.

## License

This project is available under the MIT License. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code as needed.
